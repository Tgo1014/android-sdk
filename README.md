# NStack Kotlin
NStackSDK is the companion software development kit to the NStack backend.
See the [NStack documentation](https://nstack-io.github.io/documentation/index.html) for more information about NStack


## Quick  Setup

### ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Open `build.gradle` file located in your project folder
2. Add NStack SDK dependency and sync your project
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "dk.nodes.nstack:nstack-kotlin:3.2.0"
}
```
3. After synchronisation is complete, you can start using the SDK



### âš’ Configuration
 In order to use NStack SDK you have to initilize and configure it first.

In order to connect NStack API with your application you will need `ApplicationId`, `REST API Key`. For more information how to get these keys checkout our  [Getting Start Guide](https://nstack-io.github.io/documentation/docs/guides/getting-started.html).

Put these keys as meta-data in your `AndroidManifest.xml` like so:
```xml
<application>
       <meta-data
           android:name="dk.nodes.nstack.appId"
           android:value="your application Id"
           tools:replace="android:value" />


       <meta-data
           android:name="dk.nodes.nstack.apiKey"
           android:value="your REST API key"
           tools:replace="android:value" />

       <meta-data
          android:name="dk.nodes.nstack.env"
          android:value="staging"
          tools:replace="android:value" />

          ....

</application/>
```

> You can also put these values into your `build.gradle` and use placeholders in the manifest

 Best place to initialise SDK will be in you Application `onCreate()` method as it requires your's application `Context`. `Application` is a the class for maintaining global application state. Heres a basic SDK initiation example

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
   override fun onCreate(){
     super.onCreate()
     // Specify your Translation class where translation string will be stored
     NStack.translationClass = Translation::class.java
     // initilize the SDK
     NStack.init(this)

   }
}
```
There also **optional** parameters you could make use of while using NStack SDK:

```kotlin
NStack.debugMode = true - Enables debug mode for the library (Outputs messages to log)
NStack.setRefreshPeriod(60, TimeUnit.MINUTES) - Allows you to set the period for how often NStack should check for updates
```
> Warning: In almost every instance you want to set these optional methods before NStack is initialized




## Activity Setup
Add this to which ever activity you are trying to use NStack in

```kotlin
override fun attachBaseContext(newBase: Context) {
    super.attachBaseContext(NStackBaseContext(newBase))
}
```

Pretty simple you just need to wrap your `BaseContext` with our custom wrapper

## App Open
NStack's have a feature called App open, which enable apps to pull info from several features in one API request, you can learn
more about it [here](https://nstack-io.github.io/documentation/docs/app-open.html).

Minimal setup of this feature will only require to add this line:
```kotlin
NStack.appOpen()
```

Additionaly, if you care about the outcome or want to run code afterwards, you can specify this callback
```kotlin
NStack.appOpen { success: AppOpenCallback ->
  // Your handling
 }
```
or take advantage of `Kotlin Coroutines` using `suspend` function:
```kotlin
  GlobalScope.launch {
      withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        val result: AppOpenResult = NStack.appOpen()
        when (result) {
          is AppOpenResult.Success -> // handle Success
          is AppOpenResult.Failure -> // handle failure
          is AppOpenResult.NoInternet -> // handle when offline
        }
    }
}
```

## Version Control
Version control will send the result from `appOpen` to the listener for the application to handle.
Now it's up to the app to decide how you want to handle the app update status, meaning you must provide your own way to inform the user about the update (i.e. your custom dialog and e.t.c)

> **Warning: You should set this before `appOpen`**

```kotlin
NStack.onAppUpdateListener = { appUpdate ->
    when (appUpdate.state) {
        AppUpdateState.NONE      -> {
            // Do nothing because there is no update
        }
        AppUpdateState.UPDATE    -> {
            // Show a user a dialog that is dismissible
        }
        AppUpdateState.FORCE     -> {
            // Show the user an undismissable dialog
        }
        AppUpdateState.CHANGELOG -> {
            // Show change log (Not yet implemented because its never used)
        }
    }
}
```



## Collections
The purpose of the Collections feature in NStack is to enable you, as a client, to be able to control different data sets that are shown in the app. You can learn more about collections [here](https://nstack-io.github.io/documentation/docs/features/collections.html)

In your application, you can obtain your collections either by using method with callback, or use power of Kotlin Coroutines with the `suspend` method.

Example using callback method:
```kotlin
  NStack.getCollectionResponse("slug",
      onSuccess = { response: String -> doSomething(response) },
      onError = {error: Exception -> handleError(error) }
  )
```
Example with `Coroutines`:
```kotlin
GlobalScope.launch {
    withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
      val response: String? = NStack.getCollectionResponse("slug")
      doSomething(response)
  }
}
```

## Language Selection

```kotlin
NStack.availableLanguages
```
Provides an `Arraylist<Locale>` of all available languages

```kotlin
NStack.languages
```
Provides an `HashMap<Locale, JSONObject>` of all available languages as the key and the language json object as the value

```kotlin
NStack.language = selectedLocale
```

Using any of the provided locales you are able to select a language simply by setting the `language` variable in NStack

```kotlin
NStack.setLanguageByString("en-gb")
```

Allows you to set the language by string the format must follow either the `language-country` or `language_country` format otherwise it just won't do anything

## Xml Translation

Starting in version `2.1.0` NStack-Kotlin now supports XML based translations embedded in the android namespace

```XML
android:text="{sectionName_keyName}"
android:hint="{sectionName_keyName}"
android:description="{sectionName_keyName}"
android:textOn="{sectionName_keyName}"
android:textOff="{sectionName_keyName}"
android:contentDescription="{sectionName_keyName}"
```

Method from 2.0.2+ is still supported as follows:

```XML
xmlns:nstack="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
tools:ignore="MissingPrefix"
```

Before starting with the XML translations be sure to add the following block to the root of whatever layout you're using.

```XML
nstack:key="sectionName_keyName"
nstack:text="sectionName_keyName"
nstack:hint="sectionName_keyName"
nstack:description="sectionName_keyName"
nstack:textOn="sectionName_keyName"
nstack:textOff="sectionName_keyName"
nstack:contentDescription="sectionName_keyName"
```

The following field should be used to set the nstack key `nstack:key="keyGoesHere"`

When entering the key the following format should be used `sectionName_keyName`

If you're using the NStack Gradle plugin a `nstack_keys.xml` should be generated containing all available keys it's suggested that you reference those keys when using this feature

#### Queuing Manual Translations

Once you have that setup you can trigger the translation via the following method

```kotlin
NStack.translate()
```

> **Note: Running this command is optional as the views get their translation added as they are added**

#### Clearing View Cache

If for whatever reason you need to clear the translate view cache you can trigger that view the following method

```kotlin
NStack.clearViewCache()
```

## Language Listeners
If you interested in locale changes events NStack allows you set up a `LanguageListener` like follows:
```kotlin
NStack.addLanguageChangeListener{ locale: Locale ->
  // Your code
}
```

Adds a listener to NStack that will trigger every time the language is changed (returns the new locale)


```kotlin
NStack.addLanguagesChangeListener {
}
```

This listener should trigger every time the available languages change

## N-Meta Header
Use like this:
```kotlin
.addInterceptor(NMetaInterceptor("staging"))
```
Where "staging" is a string you pass in a buildconfig flag or something similar

## Dependencies
- okhttp 3.8.0
